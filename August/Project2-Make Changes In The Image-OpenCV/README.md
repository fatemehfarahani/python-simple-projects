# Make Changes In The Image with OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to perform simple image processing and face detection tasks.

# Features:
- Reads an input image
- Resizes the image
- Converts it to grayscale
- Detects edges using the Canny algorithm
- Detects faces and draws rectangles around them
- Adds a label (text) to the image
- Saves the final output image

# Tools:
- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)

This is a basic example of working with OpenCV and handling images step by step.
